# Pipette

Pipette adds the `~>` operator with the following functionality:

- Automatic result ok tuple unwrapping
- Pipe into maps
- Pipe into lists
- Pipe into a specific function parameter (instead of the first)
- Pipe into function definition
- Skip over error tuples
- Transform error tuples (with `<~`)
- Inspect both result tuples (with simplified labels)

## Usage

Add `use Pipette` to the start of the file. This will introduce the `~>` and `<~` operators.

## Examples

See [Hex documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/pipette/)
